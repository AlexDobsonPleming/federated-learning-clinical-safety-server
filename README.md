## ðŸ”§ API SDK

An [SDK is available](https://github.com/AlexDobsonPleming/federated-learning-clinical-safety-sdk) for accessing the api in a typesafe manner.

### Testing the docker integration tests

The SDK is tested against this api with integration tests built with docker.

Test the compose file with:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up -d --build
```
